## About
COVID Containment is an incremental game about saving the world from a global pandemic!

It's open-source and it needs your help.

## Running the Game
The codebase is just a simple mix of vanilla JavaScript and jQuery. No special servers or build processes are needed. Just open the `index.html` file in whatever browser you'd like and magic will ensue.

## Contributing
It's still very early days for this so your mileage will vary here and lots of things will break.

But almost any contribution will be beneficial at this point.

If you've got an improvement, just send in a pull request. If you've got feature ideas, simply [open a new issues](https://github.com/Shpigford/covid-containment/issues/new)!

## Chat
I've set up [a Discord channel](https://discord.gg/5MFmrcc) for development (and general game discussion): https://discord.gg/5MFmrcc
